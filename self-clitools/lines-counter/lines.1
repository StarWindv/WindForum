.SH NAME
lines \- A high-performance line counter for text files with specified extensions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lines
[OPTIONS] <extension1> <extension2> ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lines
is a cross-platform, high-performance utility for counting lines of code in text files with user-specified extensions. Key features include recursive directory traversal, exclude path support, newline format detection (LF/CRLF/CR), and minimal output mode. The tool reads files in binary mode to avoid encoding issues and complies with POSIX standards for line counting (adds 1 for files with content but no trailing newline).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Display help message and exit
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-exclude <path>
Exclude a specific file or directory from line counting (supports absolute/relative paths). Exclude path matching is case-sensitive on case-sensitive filesystems (e.g., Linux).
.TP
.B \-ol, \-\-only-lines
Output only the total line count (suppresses per-file details like newline format and file paths).
.TP
.B \-sf, \-\-suppress-format
Suppress output of newline format (LF/CRLF/CR) for each processed file.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Count lines in all .cpp and .hpp files in the current directory:
.B ./lines cpp hpp
.TP
Count lines in .py files, excluding the venv directory:
.B ./lines py -e venv
.TP
Count lines in .js files and output only the total line count:
.B ./lines js -ol
.TP
Count lines in .ts files, excluding node_modules and suppressing newline format output:
.B ./lines ts -e node_modules -sf

.SH TECHNICAL NOTES
.B lines
requires a C++23-compliant compiler (clang++/g++ 13+). It leverages C++23 features like std::expected (error handling), enhanced std::ranges (directory traversal), and std::filesystem (cross-platform paths). Performance optimizations include 64KB fixed-size buffer I/O, binary mode reading, and short-circuit exclude path checks.

.SH LIMITATIONS
.IP \[bu] 2
Does not handle compressed or binary files (designed for plain text).
.IP \[bu]
Newline format detection reports the dominant format for files with mixed newlines.
.IP \[bu]
Requires C++23-compliant compilers (older toolchains are unsupported).

.SH BUGS
No known bugs at time of release. Report issues to the project repository.
